abstract = "Active control of non-axisymmetric magnetic fields has been developed to increase the plasma performances in Tokamaks and RFPs. In the past at RFX, the effect of non-axisymmetric fields, static and rotating, with m=0, n>0, was studied. Through a plasma non linear coupling, the internal tearing modes coupled with the external m=0 fields are dragged into rotation. The results have encouraged to realize a dedicated system for the generation of non-axisymmetric magnetic field by using ad hoc saddle coil arrays. One hundred and Ninety-two uniformly distributed saddle coils, each fed through switching power supply have been installed for the generation of m=0 and 1 magnetic fields in a range n=1–24. Each coil will be operated in a frequency range from dc to 300Hz and will produce a maximum field intensity of 50mT dc at the plasma surface. The resulting configuration of coils, power supplies, measurements and real time control equipment gives nowadays the most versatile system for studies of non-axisymmetric field effect on plasma. The experiments will be focused to increase the present understanding in the control of Resistive Wall Modes (RWMs) and to analyse the resonant and non-resonant MHD mode interaction with external magnetic fields, common issues for present Tokamaks and RFPs.The paper reviews the state-of-art of MHD control performed with non-axisymmetric external magnetic fields on Tokamaks and RFPs, with reference to the RWMs and field errors. The RFX contribution to the MHD mode control by external fields is discussed."

abstract = "Abstract An upgrade of the RFX-mod experiment is presently in the final design phase, aimed at widening the explored operational scenarios both in \{RFP\} and Tokamak configuration. The main design driver for this machine upgrade is the enhancement of the ‘shell-plasma proximity’, which is expected to provide a significant improvement in the plasma magnetic confinement. The achievement of this aim implies a major change of the internal components of the machine such as the removal of the present vacuum vessel, transferring the function of vacuum barrier to the duly modified toroidal support structure, and the integration of a new in-vessel support system to sustain the conductive stabilizing shell and the whole first wall. The paper presents an overview of the design choices and the proposed implementations, assessed on the base of engineering analyses and results of experimental tests performed on mock-ups of the new components. The solutions conceived to fulfill vacuum and electrical requirements of the in-vessel components, to guarantee their reliability during normal and abnormal operating conditions events, and interface compatibility with existing components and torus assembly sequence are finally highlighted.

	abstract = {This paper presents a field line tracing code (FLiT) developed to study particle and energy transport as well as other phenomena related to magnetic topology in reversed-field pinch (RFP) and tokamak experiments. The code computes magnetic field lines in toroidal geometry using curvilinear coordinates (r, ϑ, ϕ) and calculates the intersections of these field lines with specified planes. The code also computes the magnetic and thermal diffusivity due to stochastic magnetic field in the collisionless limit. Compared to Hamiltonian codes, there are no constraints on the magnetic field functional formulation, which allows the integration of whichever magnetic field is required. The code uses the magnetic field computed by solving the zeroth-order axisymmetric equilibrium and the Newcomb equation for the first-order helical perturbation matching the edge magnetic field measurements in toroidal geometry. Two algorithms are developed to integrate the field lines: one is a dedicated implementation of a first-order semi-implicit volume-preserving integration method, and the other is based on the Adams–Moulton predictor–corrector method. As expected, the volume-preserving algorithm is accurate in conserving divergence, but slow because the low integration order requires small amplitude steps. The second algorithm proves to be quite fast and it is able to integrate the field lines in many partially and fully stochastic configurations accurately. The code has already been used to study the core and edge magnetic topology of the RFX-mod device in both the reversed-field pinch and tokamak magnetic configurations.}

These states feature the presence of transport barriers in the core plasma. Here we present a method for computing the equilibrium magnetic surfaces for these states in the force-free approximation, which has been implemented in the SHEq code. The method is based on the superposition of a zeroth-order axisymmetric equilibrium and of a first-order helical perturbation computed according to Newcomb's equation supplemented with edge magnetic field measurements. The mapping of the measured electron temperature profiles, soft x-ray emission and interferometric density measurements on the computed magnetic surfaces demonstrates the quality of the equilibrium reconstruction. The procedure for computing flux surface averages is illustrated, and applied to the evaluation of the thermal conductivity profile. The consistency of the evaluated equilibria with Ohm's law is also discussed.}
