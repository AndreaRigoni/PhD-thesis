abstract = "System on Chip is a hardware solution combining different hardware devices in the same chip. In particular, the XILINX Zynq solution, implementing an ARM processor and a configurable FPGA on the same chip, is a candidate technology for a variety of applications of interest in fusion research, where FPGA fast logic must be combined with CPU processing for high-level functions and communication. Developing Zynq based applications requires the development of the FPGA logic using the XILINX Vivado IDE, mapping information between the FPGA device and the processor address space, developing the kernel drivers for interaction with the FPGA device and developing the high level application programs in user space for the supervision and the integration of the system. The paper presents a framework that integrates all the above steps and greatly simplifies the overall process. The framework has been used for the development of a programmable timing device in Wendelstein 7-X. The development of new devices integrating data acquisition and timing functions is also foreseen for RFX-mod."

abstract={The ultimate proof of our understanding of natural or technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

Particular attention is paid to the bifurcation between single helicity and multiple helicity states which is present in the phase space of a quasirelaxed RFP. Experimental evidence of transitions between bifurcated states, observed in many experiments and leading to enhanced confinement regimes, are discussed and a possible explanation for them is proposed. The role of Prandtl number in controlling transitions is discussed.}

The scaling law for the magnetic fluctuation amplitude with Lundquist number S is delta B approximately=S-0.22, which can be understood if the basic dynamic processes are governed by current sheet reconnection. Quasi-periodic oscillations are in fact found to be correlated with the presence of localized sheet currents, which for sufficiently large S make the major contribution to the average power dissipated by fluctuations. Special attention is paid to numerical convergence in the simulations. The results are compared with experimental observations}

Detailed imaging of the plasma in these conditions is presented.}

    abstract = { We present canonical linearized equations of motion for the Whipple bicycle model consisting of four rigid laterally symmetric ideally hinged parts: two wheels, a frame and a front assembly. The wheels are also axisymmetric and make ideal knife-edge rolling point contact with the ground level. The mass distribution and geometry are otherwise arbitrary. This conservative non-holonomic system has a seven-dimensional accessible configuration space and three velocity degrees of freedom parametrized by rates of frame lean, steer angle and rear wheel rotation. We construct the terms in the governing equations methodically for easy implementation. The equations are suitable for e.g. the study of bicycle self-stability. We derived these equations by hand in two ways and also checked them against two nonlinear dynamics simulations. In the century-old literature, several sets of equations fully agree with those here and several do not. Two benchmarks provide test cases for checking alternative formulations of the equations of motion or alternative numerical solutions. Further, the results here can also serve as a check for general purpose dynamic programs. For the benchmark bicycles, we accurately calculate the eigenvalues (the roots of the characteristic equation) and the speeds at which bicycle lean and steer are self-stable, confirming the century-old result that this conservative system can have asymptotic stability. }

  abstract  = {A new method to obtain the radial profile of the magnetic perturbation in a toroidal force-free plasma having a circular cross section is developed. The toroidal geometry produces poloidal harmonics in the equilibrium quantities (at the leading order m = ±1, n=0), which act as mediators between perturbations with the same toroidal number and different poloidal numbers. The approach proposed here, based on the contravariant representation of the magnetic field in flux co-ordinates, is formally simple and rigorous and maintains a nice similarity with the cylindrical treatment. The method is quite general and can be applied to any circular low-beta plasma. In this work we describe its application to the Reversed Field eXperiment (RFX) plasma. It is customary in reversed field pinches to approach the analysis of MHD instabilities by using a cylindrical geometry. Nonetheless, the effect of a more realistic toroidal geometry can play an important role, and indeed we found that the toroidal effects on the magnetic perturbations are not negligible.},

  abstract  = {Due to their discrete nature, a grid of active coils for the feedback control of plasma instabilities produces an infinite sequence of sideband harmonics in the magnetic field. If the magnetic sensors have the same periodicity as the coils, as in the intelligent shell scheme (Bishop 1989 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 31 1179), the aliasing of the sidebands determines a systematic error on the Fourier analysis of the measurements. Since the intelligent shell scheme relies on raw measurements, it does not recognize the aliasing effect. This is a drawback for error field compensation and for the control of those perturbations that cannot be suppressed by the feedback, but only reduced in their saturation level, such as the non-linear tearing modes (TMs) involved in the dynamo process of reversed field pinch machines. We have derived analytical formulae, valid in cylindrical geometry, for the subtraction of the sideband effect, and we implemented them in a real-time correction algorithm of the Fourier analysis of the magnetic measurements. The Fourier harmonics so obtained are used as the feedback variable of a new control scheme named clean-mode-control (CMC). The first tests of CMC in RFX-mod have given some interesting results in the control of the saturated TMs: besides a reduction of the radial field at the edge and the consequent plasma surface distortion, a systematic rotation of these perturbations with frequencies of up to 100 Hz is seen for the first time. This brings a mitigation of the phase-locking and wall-locking phenomena giving the possibility of operating safely at high currents.},
